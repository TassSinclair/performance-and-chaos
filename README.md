# 🐵 Chaos Workshop 💣

*Just so you know, we're only supporting Mac lappys running a recent-ish macOS.*

## To start off

* Read and then run `./setup.sh` . It will install the following:
 * [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), if you don't have it.
 * `kubectl`, which we use to control a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) instance.
 * `Minikube`, a small-scale Kubernetes instance.

## And then?
* TODO...
